magic-property
==============

*Objective-C data records made easy.*

magic-property generates immutable Objective-C classes with init, copy, isEqual and hash
methods from a simple header file.

Features
--------
 * Automatically generated immutable Objective-C classes
 * correct isEqual and hash implementation
 * init, new and copy methods for/with all properties
 * description method with human-readable output
 * all property attributes (e.g. nonatomic, strong) supported
 * ARC support
 * NSCoding and NSCopying supported
 * support for extra method implementations and custom property setters and
   accessors
 * support for custom typedefs
 * no special compiler features needed

Usage
-----

### Sample Header ####

A simple header like this is enough to generate the immutable Objective-C class:
```objective-c
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

#import "Address.h"

@interface PhonebookEntry : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong, readonly) NSString *name;
@property (nonatomic, strong, readonly) NSString *email;
@property (nonatomic, strong, readonly) NSArray *phoneNumbers;
@property (nonatomic, strong, readonly) NSString *birthday;
@property (nonatomic, strong, readonly) Address *address;
@end
```

Just add the header file to the input file of the magic-property script and the
actual class header and implementation file will be generated by the script.

### Custom methods ###

magic-property can use custom and extra methods to override the default
behavior. Simply add the methods to override or to add in a m-file. There is no
need to manually add any of the generated methods.

```objective-c
@implementation PhonebookEntry
+ (PhonebookEntry *)parseFromString:(NSString *)
{
   ... // the parse code is added to the final class by the script
}

- (NSString *)serializeToString
{
    ... // this becomes a method of the immutable class
}
@end
```
